<title>What is Interprocess Communnication</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><b>InterCommVB is a tool for fast, effective and easy inter-process (app) and
inter-thread communication and data exchange</b></p>
<p><b>Following are some important bug fixes/updates -</b></p>
<p>1>The Windows shut down bug has been fixed - Earlier InterCommVB used to
crash itself and the dependent apps when the user attempted to shut down windows
with communication channels open</p>
<p>2>Earlier, if the client app crashes unexpectedly, then the server app
never got to "know" about it... And all transmissions were reported as
successes even though they were not - This has now been fixed.</p>
<p>3>If the client or server app crashes unexpectedly, earlier it was
impossible for another client or server to connect to the same data channel on
which the crashed client or server app was operating..... Now this no longer is
a problem as InterCommVB can detect "orphaned" data channels and
redirect them appropriately and free "resource leaks" (This happens
only when a client or server app tries to register a data channel with an ID
same as that registered by the crashed client or server app. Due to performance
considerations, it is impossible to periodically check for "orphaned"
communication channels)....</p>
<p>4&gt;Earlier, when the user attempted to log out of Windows with one or more
data channels open, InterCommVB II used to display a confirmation message for
each open communication channel ! Now this bug has been fixed</p>
<p>5&gt;Now even the server app has the power to instantiate a data
communication channel. Also, two new events the OnChannelOpen and
OnConnectionWait have been implemented to support server side instantiation
better</p>
<p>6&gt;The IsChannelRegistered() function used to always return false - now
this has been fixed. Also new client side events such as
OnChannelRegistrationSuccess and OnChannelRegistrationFailure have been added</p>
<p>7&gt;InterCommVB II now includes <b>CrashGuard </b> - It can now detect within 15
seconds of a server or client crashing and automatically frees wasted resources
assoicated with the crashed app&nbsp;</p>
<p>8&gt;Added more control over the CrashGuard feature with new methods what
give the user more control....</p>
<p>9&gt;Added System Tray support with a transmission indicator, with better diagnostic and better
interactivity features</p>
<p>10&gt;There was a bug in one of the registration functions in the Client side
interface. It has now been fixed....</p>
<p>11&gt;If the server transmits some data to the client and then disconnects
before the client can process the OnDataArrival() event, the data never used to
reach the client and the transmission indicator used to remain glowing - showing
that InterCommVB is busy... And the OnServerDisconnect event never used to fire
when this happens... Now this has been fixed...</p>

Function bug..&nbsp;(Bug 6)</p>
